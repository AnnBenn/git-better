# 1. Meet GitKraken

GitKraken in a GUI (graphical user interface) tool for Git. It looks
complicated, but if you're familiar with the Git workflow, it can make things
a lot smoother.

## Clone this repository

First, you'll want to have this repository on your computer.

Open GitKraken and click on the folder icon in the upper left part of the
screen.

This will open the "Repository Management" window with three options on the
left bar: Open, Clone, and Init. Since you will be making a local copy of an
existing remote repository, you will want pick *Clone*.

Assuming you are part of the uconn-maglab GitHub organization, you will be able
to find this repository under the GitHub.com tab. Where it says "repository to clone,"
either start typing "git-better" or select it from the list.

Where it says "where to clone to," browse for the folder where you want to put
this repository (it will make a new subfolder for the repo), or type the path
in manually (note: do not use `~/` notation; this will create a folder called
`~` in your home directory).

Then hit "Clone the repo!"

When it is done cloning, there will be a message at the top of the window
asking if you want to switch to the repository now; click this button.
