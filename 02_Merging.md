# 2. Merging

## Merge your work into the main branch

Now it's time to incorporate your changes back into the main branch.

In GK, find the last commit on branch master. Right click on the master tab.
Select "Merge [your-branch-name] into master."

Now checkout to master by double-clicking on its name on the left bar under
"local." Cool, all of the changes you made on your branch are in the main
branch. (**Note:** In case you're like me and learn by trying things to see
what happens, please *do not push branch master right now*.)

## Pulling from GitHub

Just as you push your commits to GitHub, you'll need to **pull** from GitHub to
get your collaborators' commits.

Press the Pull button to fetch everyone else's branches as well as the changes
I've made to master.

## Resolving merge conflicts

Remember how I said we can't all work on the same branch or else we'll run into
a merge conflict? Yeah...here we are!
