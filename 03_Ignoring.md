# 3. Ignoring

When you're working with remotes, you will almost certainly have files that you
want to keep out of the repository.

Create a folder called `data`. Create some file in it.

Switch over to GK. You'll see the file under Unstaged Files. *Don't commit yet.*

I've added a `.gitignore` file to the repository. Pull to get it.

Now the file in `data/` should have disappeared from the Unstaged Files area.
